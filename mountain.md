## Mission Briefing: TOP SECRET

We recently recieved a communique from a source claiming to be John Bain, a british intelligence agent lost, presumed dead, after the Volkov incident. according to the message he has been being held in custody in Russia for the past several years. This may be a trap, but it is a risk we must take, the potential benefit if we can extract Mr. Bain and debrief him is invaluable. see attached documents below for facility schematics and dossiers for all relevant agents you will be working with.
