## Characters

Jane Siewert: a rich heiress, she travels with her father's man "Big Paulie"

"Big Paulie" Geovani: a friend of the Siewert family, a tough customer, but devoted.

Charles Fries: a regular train passenger, familiar with the workings of the railroad and it's policies. 

John Bain: A Brittish man of leisure, taken aback that such violence could happen right under the nose of so many Americans. 

Miss Anna Bates: a timid young lady, traveling alone, she needs a friend.

Sheriff Foster: a retired sheriff, on his way east to be put out to pasture

Frankie Pierce: "traveling medician", peddling his cures to all who needs it. many people need anxiety medicine.

Mrs. Molly O'hare: a young widow, aspiring actress, and immigrant.

Father James Black: Catholic priest, 

Lady Lucille Lancaster
Ever since my late husband passed away, it’s been hard to find solace. He was a good businessman, and a caring husband, but he died without leaving us any children. I’ve grown old without him, and still have a rather large sum of money left. I feel that my time on this earth is almost up, I need to find someone worthy to inherit my fortune, lest some greedy distant relative tries to snatch it up on a technicality. 




Doctor Clemmens
Years out west have hardened you a bit. It’s hard to be the only doctor around in an area where so much can go wrong. Now that new highfalutin city doctor showed up it finally gives you a chance to see a bit more of the world. You’ve heard that People out east don’t have much respect for self taught country doctors, so maybe it’s the retired life for you, or maybe someone here can get you a position out east. it seems one more gruesome killing has happened under your nose. 

George North
A wanted criminal. That’s what they call you. It was an accident, you never intended to go that far. Well, you hope that if you can escape to the urban jungles of the east coast that you will disappear, and everything went so well when you managed to sneak on board the train without notice. Why did someone have to get killed on this train? And now with the sheriff and the pinkerton poking around getting caught is a real possibility. I have to remain secret and hidden. 

Cassidy Durrim
I finally found him. It took me years but he didn’t escape me this time. Sheriff Foster will pay for killing my pa. They called him an outlaw, but he was just doing what he had to in order to feed me. The Sheriff’s job was to protect people, but he was just a killer with a badge. It would have been easier to sneak into his car the night before we disembarked the train and kill him in his sleep, but it seems that that is no longer an option. If I want my Pa to have justice I will need to kill him before the Marshals arrive. Then I suppose I will need to find a way to make a life for myself.






Ed Marshall
You’re working your dream job on the Union Pacific Railroad working as a conductor on transcontinental passenger trains, and have been for decades, but now someone’s had to make a mess of things by murdering a passenger. Now in addition to keeping the train’s paperwork current and checking tickets, you have to contain the passengers that were around the murder into the last couple cars of the train while the murder is investigated. Anything that messes with YOUR train is not appreciated and will be dealt with harshly, as there’s nothing you love more than a smoothly operating train and railroad and you take the greatest pride in your work. Also as a very young man you served in the Union Army during the civil war, though now you’re approaching retirement a lot sooner than you’d like.


James Barnett
You’re an all around crook, but a charismatic one at least. At noon you’re planning on robbing the train as part of an organized theft ring, which includes another passenger Jessie Doyle. The murder that’s put everyone else on high alert may make things more difficult then but there’s no way to call off your other outside help now. In the meantime though, you will pursue your “day job”/cover and attempt you sell your excellent high quality patented Snakeoil cures to your fellow passengers, while also trying to figure out who has what that might be worth nabbing later.


Jessie Doyle
You are part of a thievery ring that is planning to rob the train at noon. In the meantime you need to mingle inconspicuously with the other passengers to scope out who has what worth stealing so your ring can grab and go quickly when the clock strikes noon. You also are curious about the murder, perhaps the victim was killed for their wealth? And if so, who has it now, as it much have been significant coin to justify murder. The snake oil salesman, James Barnett, is also part of the ring. 


Ethel Havely
You grew up on a California Homestead before your now-husband Howard swept you off your feet. However his ambitions in gold prospecting didn’t pan out and now he’s returning home and taking you along back to his home state of Pennsylvania. Having never been out east in the more “Civilized” portions of the country before, you have a great feeling of nervous anticipation in your gut and are worried you won’t fit in in the East, but at the same time you love your husband, are looking forward to starting a family with him and would follow him to the ends of the earth.




Howard Havely
You once had a great dream of making it big prospecting for gold in California and sticking it to all those people who had playing it safe in life by getting factory jobs in your home state of Pennsylvania, who all called you crazy for daring to dream. But now you’re basically returning nearly empty-handed and with your tail between your legs having found no gold and barely fed yourself doing odd jobs around your failed prospecting. On the bright side, now you’re accompanied by you new wife, Ethel, who to you is worth more than her weight in gold. Even though you dread the boring factory job with long hours you’ll probably need to support her and a future family, perhaps she was California Gold after all. You would defend her with your life if necessary.


Tharza “Trigger” Teusday A.K.A Marya Volkov

John Bain and I have had quite the trip so far. I know he is traveling with me just to have someone else, I know he didn’t actually care for me at the start, but has he started to? I have, but my duty comes first. The Tzars are counting on me, I must help Bain to locate the lost intel, snatch the documents from him, and leave him to take the fall, but I am conflicted, shall  I betray the man I love? or shall I betray my country? Well, we have to find the documents first, then I will decide.

Alexei Chebrikov, aka “Alex Vogel”
Congratulations Comrade, you have been hand-picked by Comrade Andropov for this assignment, and given the personal approval of General Secretary Brezhnev. Soviet scientists have detected a disturbing space-time anomaly that threatens to undo our Great Proletarian Workers Paradise, and you have been sent back in time to 1902 to fix it. On the Eastbound Transcontinental Express is a British Defector carrying secrets they intend to hand over to the American Capitalist Pigs, along with another British Spy sent to ensure those secrets die with the defector before they can be passed on. If the British Spy is successful in assassinating the Defector before their intel can be handed over, a great series of events will be initiated that culminate in the failure of the October Revolution and Communism will fail to rise in Russia. Even though you have some trouble disguising your accent Comrade, your mission is to assume the cover identity of “Alex Vogel”, a capitalist pig traveling from California to New York on business, discover the identity of the British Spy and covertly eliminate the threat to our Motherland and her glorious Communist future before it is too late. Nobody can know your true identity, mission or that you are from the future, as that itself may further alter the timeline in unpredictable ways that also threaten the Motherland. Good Luck Comrade.





Reginald T Frost
Str: 10 Dex: 13 Int: 18 WIS: 18 CON: 10 CHA: -4
You were considered the ‘dumb’ one in your family. Father, and your older brothers, Rupert and Reynard, might be smarter than you, but none of them do anything with their brains. Instead of sitting around writing stuffy old books on subjects nobody cares about, you left home and decided to be a consulting detective. You started at Scotland yard, but you didn’t get along with your superior, who was actually extremely inferior, LeStrade. You set up your own shop, but you had trouble keeping your clients long enough to finish the case and get paid. You were accidentally called on a case in France. Where you met Doctor Flambeaux and where, with a lot of terrific publicity, you solved the case and got paid (a lot). You split the money with the good doctor and convinced her that she could make a lot more coming back to England with you. Over the past 2 years, you and she have become wealthy enough to do cases just for the fun of it (she doesn’t look on it that way. She is a do-gooder and likes people and actually likes to help them. That is why she manages to keep the clients around long enough for you to get paid.) Things have been a little quiet in London, Flambeaux and I are on our way back from solving what she calls “The Crimson Case” in Salt lake city. Now this murder has happened, what luck!
Doctor Claudette Flambeaux
After a successful resolution of the Crimson Case in Salt Lake, you and Detective Frost have boarded this train. Another murder happened last night, seems your job of keeping Frost from alienating every single person on this train is about to get a lot harder. On top of that those you truly work for have tasked you with acquiring a secret document on this train, you had determined it was Mr. Baker who had it before he died, now who knows who has it, it must be found, and secured before the culprit has a chance to abscond. Frost should be of help here.
