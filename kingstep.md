# The Fall of King's Step

## Overview

"King's Step is Lost" 
That is What you awoke to find this morning. There have been rumors floating around of a Demonic Horde rampaging across the land, as the rumors grew worse and worse, and the horde approached, movement starting to come from the king's castle. people started to stockpile goods, assuming the king was preparing for a siege.
This morning, everyone awoke to find that the king and his retinue had fled the city, with most the army. Now you are left here, a small band of adventurers, what will you do? Try and find your own escape before the city falls? Try and take as many civilians with you as you can? Try and mount a defense of the city in the absense of any authority?
The choice is up to you, but one thing is for sure, time is running out before the fall of king's step.

## Characters

### Sir Gregory Edgemont
A Disgraced knight, you once fought for the king, your family held positions of power and influence throughout the kingdom, but due to unfortunate circumstances you became disgraced, your family lost their seat on the council, and you were forced to become a sellsword. Some of your extended family are still in the city, though most the people you knew either left the city before or were with the king when he fled last night. Do you have enough valor left in your dishonored bones to try one last time to be a shield against injustice? or have you become to old and jaded to sacrifice any more?

### Sindra, Herald of the Flame
A Powerful, if young fire sorceress, filled with a strong lust for life that few seem to match. she sometimes is distracted, and even seems to lose herself to a madness no one else understands. She is the newest addition to the party, having arrived at the same time many were fleeing the city. a weird oddity of her is that she weild an electric blade, which is incongruous with her fire magic. 

### Loop, The Wanderer
An older man, at least in his fifties, perhaps older. his best adventuring days are over, but he still has a lot of the stength of youth and his eyes are still sharp. being in the presence of magic seems to cause him discomfort, but he uses that to his advantage, since it means he can always sense when magic is being cast in his presence. he was once a famed ranger, and still weilds the bow and sword proficiently.

### Grounds Keeper
An automoton, or so it appears. it is of unknown age and origin. its main goals seem to be the laying of the dead to rest and cleansing the world of those who would do evil. it also seems to have some sort of grudge against gnomes, though it is unclear why. it does not talk of its past. it always speaks in what it thinks is a soothing voice, and its variety of healing and light magics are extensive. Sometimes it seems like it does what is right by compulsion, against its will moreso than because it's what it wants to do.

### Vanessa, of Many Faces
The others find it hard to trust you, just because you can change your face and shape. it's not like you chose to be this way, you were born like this. you've had to learn to use your ability to survive in a world that is hostile to your kind, and most kinds at that. you've stolen, cheated, seduced, and lied your way for most your life. Now you have turned a new leaf, these people might not all be saints, but they trust you, and you were finally starting to learn to trust in return, but will you risk everything if they choose to stay? the thought of having to be alone again terrifies you, but dying is scary too, you must try and convince them to save themselves, but if they don't, what will you do?

### Zanka, Young Archeologist
You have traveled far in search of knowledge. many lands have you seen, in spite of your young age. You wish to see many more lands, to uncover ancient knowledge and teasures that will help you to put together the mysteries of this world's ancient past. you have your theories about the the demons too, from what little you've seen, they have their own artifacts and items of power. perhaps you could gain something from them, if only you could speak to them. Only one thing stands in the way of your search of knowledge, Sindra. you can't keep your eyes off her, you feel crazy and brave around her, but you don't think she even notices you most the time. you know whatever happens you will stay with her, even if that means facing the entire horde just the two of you. 

### ????
Who is this guy? Where'd he come from? why won't he leave?
